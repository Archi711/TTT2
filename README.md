# TTT2
a basic, too easy version of TicTacToe.

TicTacToe game built using React, Socket.io.

Node server with socket and games management, front end in React.

I want to make as simple as possible. 
Later of course UPGRADE!

### TODOS

1. Make Modal component



FUTURE: 
1.Make server handle game, chat, spectators, showing available lobbys... 

2. Collect data from games and make with TensorFlow TicTacToe champion AI.
